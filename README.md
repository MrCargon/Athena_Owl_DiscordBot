<summary><strong>Enabling Internet access 🌐🔍(Click to Expand)</strong></summary>

To ensure that the bot has access to the most up-to-date information, you can enable internet access by setting the `INTERNET_ACCESS` parameter to true in the `config.yml` file. This will allow the bot to retrieve information beyond the data it was initially trained on, which was only available up until 2021.
